## Core Features:

- Anonymous User Registration: Allow students to register anonymously with a generated ID, name, and secret recovery phrase, which allows users to proceed with logging their information and seeking help, with a bare minimum of risk to their personal privacy.
- PHQ-9 Test: Administer the PHQ-9 test, auto-score the results, and categorize the student's mental health status.
- Helpline Redirection: Based on the PHQ-9 score, redirect students to the appropriate resources: Helpline page for severe cases, AI Chatbot for moderate/low cases.
- AI Chatbot Support: Provide an AI-powered chatbot to offer coping strategies, breathing exercises, and journaling prompts, using contextual awareness as a tool.
- Crisis Intervention: Detect trigger words (suicide, self-harm) in the chatbot conversation and instantly redirect the student to the Helpline/Counselor page. Uses contextual awareness of previous conversation history to avoid false positives.
- Counselor/Helpline Page: Display India-specific helpline numbers (KIRAN, Snehi, etc.) and offer the option to book a mock counseling slot.
